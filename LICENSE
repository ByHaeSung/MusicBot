A simple music bot written in discord.py using youtube-dl.
Though it's a simple example, music bots are complex and require much time and knowledge until they work perfectly.
Use this as an example or a base for your own bot and extend it as you want. If there are any bugs, please let me know.
Requirements:
Python 3.5+
pip install -U discord.py pynacl youtube-dl
You also need FFmpeg in your PATH environment variable or the FFmpeg.exe binary in your bot's directory on Windows.
